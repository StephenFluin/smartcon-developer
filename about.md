# About SmartCon Developer 
This event was created to try to serve developers across the blockchain ecosystem. The pace of innovation and distruption in this industry is greater than almost any other industry, which means that developers need great sources of news, information, and context to stay up to date and to stay connected. Developers want to be in-the-know about their favorite technologies and tools, they want to become better more effective developers, and they want to discover what might be coming next in the space.

We created SmartCon Developer to try to bring together some of the changemakers and key technologies that we all rely on every day to get our jobs done. This event should be less about sales pitches for services and blockchains, and more about capturing the innovation and momentum of the industry.
